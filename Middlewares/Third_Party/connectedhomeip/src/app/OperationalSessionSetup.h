/**
 * Object used to either establish a connection to peer or performing address lookup to a peer.
 *
 * OperationalSessionSetup is capable of either:
 *    1. Establishing a CASE session connection to a peer. Upon success or failure, the OnDeviceConnected or
 *       OnDeviceConnectionFailure callback will be called to notify the caller the results of trying to
 *       estblish a CASE session. Some additional details about the steps to establish a connection are:
 *          - Discover the device using DNSSD (find out what IP address to use and what
 *            communication parameters are appropriate for it)
 *          - Establish a secure channel to it via CASE
 *          - Expose to consumers the secure session for talking to the device via OnDeviceConnected
 *            callback.
 *    2. Performing an address lookup for given a scoped nodeid. On success, it will call into
 *       SessionManager to update the addresses for all matching sessions in the session table.
 *
 * OperationalSessionSetup has a very limited lifetime. Once it has completed its purpose outlined above,
 * it will use `releaseDelegate` to release itself.
 *
 * It is possible to determine which of the two purposes the OperationalSessionSetup is for by calling
 * IsForAddressUpdate().
