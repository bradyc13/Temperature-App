/**
 *    @file
 *      This file contains definitions for working with data encoded in CHIP TLV format.
 *
 *      CHIP TLV (Tag-Length-Value) is a generalized encoding method for simple structured data. It
 *      shares many properties with the commonly used JSON serialization format while being considerably
 *      more compact over the wire.
